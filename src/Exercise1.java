        //In 250 words or less: In your own words - describe the concept and mechanisms used in inheritance

    /* Inheritance is a way to reduce repetitions in every class you make. If you have a class, the parent class, there have some common attributes,
    and you have another class, children class, which has the same attribute, and some other ones, then instead of writing the attribute from the parents class,
    in the children class, you can extend the children class to the parent class, then the children class automatically inheritance the attributes from the parent class.
    When a class inheritance from another class it is also easier to use methods. Cause the method is automatically extended to the other class and can be used "freely".
    You can extend as many classes as you would like, but you can only have one parent class

    If example you have an animal class, the parent class. As attributes, you might have "age", "colour", "name", cause that is something that animals often have.
    If you then might have two other classes, example dog and cat, instead of writing the attributes "age", "colour" and "name" in each of the other classes, then we extends
    from the parent class as: Animal.Animal.Dog extends Animal.Animal, and Cat extends Animal.Animal, then the attributes from the Animal.Animal class is automatically valid in the Animal.Animal.Dog and Cat classes. You just have to "call" them.
